                <p> Christopher was born on October 27, 1925, in Scranton, North Dakota. Upon his
                    father’s death at an early age, his mother moved the family to California. He
                    earned a B.S. with honors from the University of Southern California in 1945 and
                    entered Stanford University Law School in 1946 after completing service in the
                    U.S. Naval Reserve. He received the L.L.B. from Stanford in 1949 and clerked for
                    Supreme Court Justice <persName>William O. Douglas</persName> for a year.</p>
                <p>As a lawyer between 1950 and 1967, he consulted on, and helped negotiate numerous
                    international treaties for the Department of State. In 1965 he served on
                    California Governor Edmund G. Brown’s Commission to investigate urban riots in
                    Watts, California.</p>
                <p>In 1967, President <persName>Lyndon Baines Johnson</persName> appointed him
                    Deputy Attorney General of the United States, a position he held for two years.
                    In 1977, President <persName>Jimmy Carter</persName> appointed him Deputy
                    Secretary of State, a position he held for four years. He served as the
                    Department of State’s Chief Negotiator during the <ref

                        from 1979 to 1980</ref>. In 1992, after serving as head of the Commission
                    investigating the Los Angeles Police Department, he served as the Head of
                    President-elect Clinton’s Transition Team. </p>

                <p>Christopher eschewed confrontation in favor of negotiation with friend and foe
                    alike. He encouraged Israel, the Palestinians, and Jordan to sign peace
                    treaties, resulting in the <ref target="/milestones/1993-2000/oslo">Oslo
                        Accords</ref> and the Israel-Jordan peace treaty in 1993 and 1994
                    respectively. He promoted the Partnership for Peace Program, which advocated the
                    expansion of NATO eastward into the former Soviet bloc nations, in 1994. In 1995
                    he convinced President Clinton to officially restore diplomatic relations with
                    Vietnam. Later that year, he successfully conducted negotiations between Serbia
                    and Bosnia that resulted in the Dayton Accords and the end of the Bosnian
                    War.</p>
