                <p><hi rend="italic">Sports and Diplomacy in the Global Arena</hi> is an
                    instructional package that explores the relationship between sports and
                    diplomacy throughout history. The video begins with the creation of the Olympics
                    in ancient Greece and continues through the present day. </p>
                <p>This package also includes the video script, a timeline, glossary, lessons and
                    extension activities, website links, and other support materials. Lessons focus
                    on history, civics, geography, economics, and culture and support the thematic
                    curriculum strands of Expectations of Excellence: Curriculum Standards for
                    Social Studies of the National Council for the Social Studies. Lessons and
                    support materials were also designed to promote the literacy emphasis of No
                    Child Left Behind by including oral, written, and visual communication
                    activities.</p>
                <p>These instructional materials were designed to provide a high degree of
                    flexibility for classroom teachers. The video can be viewed in its entirety or
                    in segments and used to stimulate class-room discussion, as an introduction to a
                    series of lessons on the topic, or to supplement existing lessons. The video and
                    print materials may constitute a complete instructional unit, or individual
                    elements may be incorporated into existing units. The lessons and materials
                    support U.S. history, government, political science, economics, international
                    relations, and modern world history courses. </p>
                <p>Teachers are encouraged to enhance the content of this package with other
                    instructional materials and information sources, such as textbooks, newspapers,
                    television, and the internet. Suggestions for using additional resources are
                    included with a number of the lessons. Teachers are encouraged to modify
                    suggested lessons and other materials in ways that are appropriate for their
                    students, courses, and other local circumstances.</p>
                <p>Print materials in the package are provided in black-on-white format. They may be
                    easily reproduced by photo copying, or scanned into computer files to enable
                    teachers to customize materials for their own classrooms. Some websites in the
                    list of resources may have copyright restrictions, and teachers are advised to
                    review and abide by those restrictions. All print materials in this package
                    produced by the U.S. Department of State may be reproduced and disseminated
                    without specific permission.</p>
