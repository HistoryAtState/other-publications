                    <ref target="/frus150">began publication in 1861</ref>. Prior to that time, the
                    U.S. government released documents through a variety of means. One of those
                    means was the U.S. Congressional Serial Set, which began publication in 1817.
                    Your local library may hold the Serial Set or subscribe to an electronic
                    database which contains these documents. There are two indexes of the foreign
                    relations materials in the Serial Set. Between 1914 and 1921, Adelaide Rosalia
                    Hasse compiled a three-volume <ref
